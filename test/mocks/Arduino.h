/*
 Provides types declaration defined in the real Arduino.h and used by the DLPacket library.
 Note: The int type used in Arduiono code has a resolution of 16 bits, but depending on the
 compiling environment used for the tests, int could have a higher resolution. However, in this
 library it should not matter.
